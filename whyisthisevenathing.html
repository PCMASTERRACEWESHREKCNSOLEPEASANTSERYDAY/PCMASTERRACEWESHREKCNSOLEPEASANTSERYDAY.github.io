<p>If you aren't playing chess or something of the sort on a mobile device, something is wrong with you.
I know, once in a while we all resort to playing a garbage mobile game once in a while 
when we're on the toilet at work or are on some sort of transportion, but unless you are super desperate for 
something to do mobile gaming is never the choice. I'll admit, some games are addicting but 
you must try to avoid getting cancer. If you, like us believe the same way, then consider donating to us at:
to support our cause. Please help clean the world, 1 mobile gamer at a time.</p>
